Since exercise 1 was solved in class, only exercise has been commented with javadoc style. Each class has at the beggining of the file a small description of its meaning and the task that performs. The javadoc files have been attached to the zip file. 

To TEST this exercise the string variables copy_path_folder and origin_path_folder have to be changed in the main program(Class Exo2.java). The copy_path_folder folder should be empthy and the origin_path_folder folder should contain ONLY regular files.
